# Power BI Project: Mortality Age Specific by Country

### Dataset Link : https://ghdx.healthdata.org/record/ihme-data/gbd-2010-mortality-results-1970-2010

## Overview

This visualization illustrates the mortality rates across various age groups, years, and countries. Throughout this project, we addressed several critical questions:

    1. How do mortality rates differ between countries in specific years, based on age and gender?
    2. Which age group has the highest mortality rate?
    3. How has the overall mortality rate evolved over time?

### Key Takeaways from this Project

- Effective use of filters to manage a vast dataset encompassing 187 countries over 5 years.
- Assigning a new category for age to better manage grouping.
- Applied a range of visualizations, such as bar charts, pie charts, and treemaps.

The resulting visualization provides a comprehensive overview of how mortality rates have changed over time by country and in aggregate. It also highlights the relationship between mortality rates, gender, and age groups.


### Note:
Similar dataset with Tableau project, different visualization.
